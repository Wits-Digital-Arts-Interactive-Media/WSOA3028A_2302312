                <h3>GitHub Pages & Goals</h3>
                <p>I worked as a software dev intern over the December recess, and a colleague of mine had their
                    portfolio as a site on GitHub pages. At the time, my only portfolio was a combination of Itch.io for
                    projects and LinkedIn for everything else. I was so impressed with her portfolio and was adamant on
                    making one for myself, I just didn’t know where to begin. Then along came this course with timing
                    that could not have been better. Learning about GitHub pages and how to set it up was an incredibly
                    easy eye opener. I couldn’t believe that free webhosting was so accessible. I had always thought
                    that it would cost a crazy monthly fee to have a portfolio website hosted online.
                    I am very excited to make a portfolio website and I hope to make one that I can take further into my
                    career and be proud of.

                <h3> The World Wide Web – Berners-Lee et al.</h3>
                Reading a perspective of the internet from the time of its infancy is truly fascinating. Seeing
                something so familiar to us be explained as if it is the wildest concept really puts things into
                perspective.

            <section>
                <p> I created the first rough wireframes for the project this week. I wanted the website to have a
                    pretty
                    standard layout so as not to confuse or intimidate any users. When looking for inspiration, I saw
                    many websites that had users interacting with them in ways not unlike a video game. One made users
                    drive a little car around in a world and each location was a piece of the website. another was a
                    linear sidescroller that had users control a little character running through the website. These
                    websites were very impressive and innovative, I love how they challenged the normal idea of website
                    navigation. However, I think for a portfolio website, I don't want to scare off potential
                    employers/clients because they were too overwhelmed with an unfamiliar way of navigating the web. As
                    such, I have decided on the standard home bar at the top of the screen that collapses into a smaller
                    version when users scroll down. I want my website to feel easy to navigate, but I still want some
                    gems of originality sprinkled around it. These should be non essential to the flow of the site but
                    still a treat to find. I'm not sure what these 'gems' will be yet though.</p>

                <h3>Alignment</h3>
                <p> I want my website to clearly showcase the skills I have learned throughout the course of my degree.
                    I think the best way to do this is to present all my projects with a name, short description, and a
                    list of the most prominent skills used/learned in the project. Users can then click on the project
                    to see it in depth, with a long description, multiple screenshots, and a download link. I want my
                    users to be able to quickly see all of my skills at a glance and then be able to see each skill
                    demonstrated in multiple projects. As such, they should have the ability to filter the project page
                    by skill.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>Primarily, my intended audience consists of potential clients, employers and recruiters. They would
                    probably like to see a brief description of me, and then my past work and experience. Users could
                    potentially be looking for experience with specific software or a specific skill.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>Projects should indicate the skills that went into making them. I believe this gives users a good
                    idea of what kind of project they are browsing before they even know what the project is. This is
                    especially important for me as the majority of my projects are more technically impressive than they
                    are visually impressive. I need to “sell” the projects based on the challenging aspect that they
                    achieved rather than the impressive art that went into them.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>The Blog, Essay, and Design pages will supplement the projects page by providing extra insight into
                    my
                    personality and thought process as I design. This is important as users look at more than just
                    technical experience and skill. A portfolio page should represent what sets me apart from other
                    designers/developers, and that is who I am and how I think.</p>

                <h3>Progress Update</h3>
                <p>I think the website is progressing well. This is my first time working in HTML and my first time
                designing anything similar to a website. I think for this first milestone the goal is to have a
                functional skeleton of the website, and that is what I have. It’s not pretty and it doesn’t do anything
                fancy, but its navigates between pages and displays content in a way that humans and (hopefully) bots
                can read and understand. I think I have all the needed semantic markup in. I still need to add a footer
                with links to external sites and implement the design page. However the blog page is done for now as
                soon as I post this one.
