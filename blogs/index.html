            <p>I worked as a software dev intern over the December recess, and a colleague of mine had their
                portfolio as a site on GitHub pages. At the time, my only portfolio was a combination of Itch.io for
                projects and LinkedIn for everything else...

            <section>
                <p> I created the first rough wireframes for the project this week. I wanted the website to have a
                    pretty
                    standard layout so as not to confuse or intimidate any users...

            <section>
                <p> I want my website to clearly showcase the skills I have learned throughout the course of my degree.
                    I think the best way to do this is to present all my projects with a name, short description, and a
                    list of the most prominent skills used/learned in the project...</p>

                <p>I think the website is progressing well. This is my first time working in HTML and my first time
                    designing anything similar to a website. I think for this first milestone the goal is to have a
                    functional skeleton of the website...
