            <p>I worked as a software dev intern over the December recess, and a colleague of mine had their
                portfolio as a site on GitHub pages. At the time, my only portfolio was a combination of Itch.io for
                projects and LinkedIn for everything else...

            <section>
                <p> I created the first rough wireframes for the project this week. I wanted the website to have a
                    pretty
                    standard layout so as not to confuse or intimidate any users...

            <section>
                <p> I want my website to clearly showcase the skills I have learned throughout the course of my degree.
                    I think the best way to do this is to present all my projects with a name, short description, and a
                    list of the most prominent skills used/learned in the project...</p>

                <p>I think the website is progressing well. This is my first time working in HTML and my first time
                    designing anything similar to a website. I think for this first milestone the goal is to have a
                    functional skeleton of the website...</p>

                <p>We were tasked to write an essay analysing the User Experience (UX) and User Interface(UI) of a website that
                    renders services in South Africa. When selecting a website to analyse for my essay, I followed two steps... </p>

            <section>
               
                <p>Bryan Cantrill Spoke at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wtvQZijPzg">Craft in 2019</a> about some key Ethical Dilemmas in Software engineering and the future
                    implications thereof for the field. I found the talk very interesting as in it he mentioned many things that
                    occurred during my life...</p>

            <h2><a href="posts/blog7.html">Week 9 - 18/04/24: JavaScript</a></h2>
            <section>
               
                <p>I started experimenting with JavaScript on my website. From what I can gather, JavaScript in its simplest
                    sense addresses the limitations of HTML by allowing for functions that can implement logic. It also allows
                    for webpages to react dynamically without the user having to refresh the page...</p>

            <section>
                <p>After reading this text, the first thing to come to mind is how Spotify neglects their appâ€™s performance to
                    users with poor internet connectivity. Spotify is primarily a music streaming service, but it does allow its
                    users to download music to their devices to be played offline...</p>
