        <h1>Week 3 - 16/02/2024: Alignment</h1> 
                <p> I want my website to clearly showcase the skills I have learned throughout the course of my degree.
                    I think the best way to do this is to present all my projects with a name, short description, and a
                    list of the most prominent skills used/learned in the project. Users can then click on the project
                    to see it in depth, with a long description, multiple screenshots, and a download link. I want my
                    users to be able to quickly see all of my skills at a glance and then be able to see each skill
                    demonstrated in multiple projects. As such, they should have the ability to filter the project page
                    by skill.</p>
           
                <p>Primarily, my intended audience consists of potential clients, employers and recruiters. They would
                    probably like to see a brief description of me, and then my past work and experience. Users could
                    potentially be looking for experience with specific software or a specific skill.</p>
          
                <p>Projects should indicate the skills that went into making them. I believe this gives users a good
                    idea of what kind of project they are browsing before they even know what the project is. This is
                    especially important for me as the majority of my projects are more technically impressive than they
                    are visually impressive. I need to “sell” the projects based on the challenging aspect that they
                    achieved rather than the impressive art that went into them.</p>
          
                <p>The Blog, Essay, and Design pages will supplement the projects page by providing extra insight into
                    my
                    personality and thought process as I design. This is important as users look at more than just
                    technical experience and skill. A portfolio page should represent what sets me apart from other
                    designers/developers, and that is who I am and how I think.</p>
