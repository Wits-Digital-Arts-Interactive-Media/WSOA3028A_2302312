            Week 1 - 16/02/2024: wireframes and inspiration
        </h1>
        <p> I created the first rough wireframes for the project this week. I wanted the website to have a
            pretty
            standard layout so as not to confuse or intimidate any users. When looking for inspiration, I saw
            many websites that had users interacting with them in ways not unlike a video game. One made users
            drive a little car around in a world and each location was a piece of the website. another was a
            linear sidescroller that had users control a little character running through the website. These
            websites were very impressive and innovative, I love how they challenged the normal idea of website
            navigation. However, I think for a portfolio website, I don't want to scare off potential
            employers/clients because they were too overwhelmed with an unfamiliar way of navigating the web. As
            such, I have decided on the standard home bar at the top of the screen that collapses into a smaller
            version when users scroll down. I want my website to feel easy to navigate, but I still want some
            gems of originality sprinkled around it. These should be non essential to the flow of the site but
            still a treat to find. I'm not sure what these 'gems' will be yet though.</p>
