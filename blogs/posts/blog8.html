        <h1>Week 10 - 25/04/24: Lutz 2019 Digital Inequalities in the Age of AI and Big Data
        </h1>
        <p> After reading this text, the first thing to come to mind is how Spotify neglects their app’s performance to
            users with poor internet connectivity. Spotify is primarily a music streaming service, but it does allow its
            users to download music to their devices to be played offline. The app fails to perform with low
            connectivity though. When a device has an internet connection but bad signal, the app will show a loading
            screen as it desperately tries to connect to its servers, This loading screen is prominent even if the user
            is trying to access downloaded content. After about 10 seconds the app will finally accept it is offline and
            show the requested content. Although this is only a mere frustration to users and doesn’t render the app
            unusable, it showcases a greater issue with the software development industry. Services are developed with
            little to no regard to how users in third-world countries will interact with said services. There is little
            care given to ensure that users with less infrastructure will be affected by certain features. In cases
            where these features cant be turned off, this is a serious issue. Take for instance, Whatsapp’s new update:
            It ships with a new GPT-style chatbot built into the app’s search bar. This feature cannot be disabled and
            uses mobile data to poll the AI every time a user searches any chats. This could pose serious issues for
            users who have a very limited amount of data each month. Overall, I think it is very important that
            companies consider lesser privileged users and should make features that require a stable internet
            connection optional if they aren’t crucial to the main functionality of the software.</p>
