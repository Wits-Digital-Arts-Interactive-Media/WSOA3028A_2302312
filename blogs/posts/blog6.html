        <h1>Week 8 - 08/04/24: Ethical Dilemmas in Software Engineering</h1>
        <p> Bryan Cantrill Spoke at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wtvQZijPzg">Craft in 2019</a> about some
            key Ethical Dilemmas in Software engineering and the future
            implications thereof for the field. I found the talk very interesting as in it he mentioned many things that
            occurred during my life when I had access to the internet but had no idea of. Last week, I did a case study
            on the tragic failure of the 1992 London Ambulance Service Computer Aided Dispatch specifically focusing on
            the ethics of the companies behind the failure. This was, however, before good software engineering
            principles and an ethical code therefore existed.</p>

        <p>The cases mentioned in this talk were recent and thus showed me software engineering ethics through a new
            lens. All the cases I’ve heard of or studied stand evident of the root issue that Bryan mentioned: the goal
            of all software is to reduce human intervention and automate tasks, however, most of these ethical dilemmas
            are caused by just that: not enough human supervision. That is not to say that all software is evil.
            Developers must just carefully consider their products and its possible uses. For example, this website I’m
            making: It allows me to advertise my projects and showcase my work as a designer so that I don’t have to
            carry a folder of my portfolio to show any interested people. It is my ethical responsibility, since my
            portfolio is now accessible by anyone, to give disclaimers if any of my work may be unsettling to some
            audiences.</p>

        <p>I also mentioned some ethical issues with Steam’s website in my essay. It is apparent that ethics should be a
            primary concern for anyone working in this field.</p>
