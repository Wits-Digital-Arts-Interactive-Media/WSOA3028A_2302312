        <h1>Week 6 - 18/03/24: Essay 1, Website selection</h1>
        <p> We were tasked to write an essay analysing the User Experience (UX) and User Interface(UI) of a website that
            renders services in South Africa. When selecting a website to analyse for my essay, I followed two steps:
            First I had to decide whether the website should have remarkably good UXUI or bad UXUI. Either can be
            analysed quite thoroughly, and realistically any website I choose will have a bit of both. I decided,
            however, to look for a website with obvious flaws as I thought this would give me more content to write
            about. Secondly, I tried to think back on any websites that annoyed me from a user’s perspective in the past
            and made a list. I then revisited each of these sites and was somewhat disappointed that they seemingly
            fixed all the issues that I had long ago. I could naturally write about the improvements that they had made,
            but I did not have enough faith in my memory of the old versions. Some key highlights of websites I
            considered:</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.sterkinekor.com/">Ster-Kinekor</a></h2>
        <p>I remember many times when I attempted to book tickets to movies and wanted to pull my hair out at the
            unintuitive user flow that Ster-Kinekor’s website offered. I also remember a significant lack of feedback
            for when tickets were actually bought. The site would simply return to the homepage after payment
            confirmation without showing the tickets. The tickets were then e-mailed to the user, but there was always a
            gap where I had no idea where my tickets were, as the site did not tell me they would be e-mailed. Luckily
            both of these issues seem to be fixed now with a fully overhauled site. So it was no longer a contender for
            an analysis.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.aramex.com/za/en/home">Aramex</a></h2>
        <p>Aramex is a courier company of which I had the pleasure of crawling their entire website when my package got
            lost a couple of years ago. The website seemed to take a grocery store-styled approach to the user journey,
            where all the popular items are spaced as far away from each other as possible. This is either a very bad
            way to design a website or a very unethical one depending on the intentions of the designer. Their website
            too, however, has been entirely reworked and is now very well designed in my opinion.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a></h2>
        <p>I decided to choose a website that I had a more recent experience with and have been experiencing frequently
            in the past year: Steam. Although I have not often experienced Steam’s website directly, it does facilitate
            most of the functionality in the desktop and mobile applications where the apps simply act as custom
            browsers. As such I have used the website indirectly very often. The Steam website has some obvious flaws,
            like overwhelming UI and ambiguous buttons, and less obvious ones like the store catalogue being the home
            page. It seemingly has a lot to write about, and I have quite some experience as a user so minimal research
            would be necessary.</p>
