        <h2>GitHub Pages & Goals</h2>
        <p id="first">
            I worked as a software dev intern over the December recess, and a colleague of mine had their
            portfolio as a site on GitHub pages. At the time, my only portfolio was a combination of Itch.io for
            projects and LinkedIn for everything else. I was so impressed with her portfolio and was adamant on
            making one for myself, I just didn’t know where to begin. Then along came this course with timing
            that could not have been better. Learning about GitHub pages and how to set it up was an incredibly
            easy eye opener. I couldn’t believe that free webhosting was so accessible. I had always thought
            that it would cost a crazy monthly fee to have a portfolio website hosted online.
            I am very excited to make a portfolio website and I hope to make one that I can take further into my
            career and be proud of.

            Reading a perspective of the internet from the time of its infancy is truly fascinating. Seeing
            something so familiar to us be explained as if it is the wildest concept really puts things into
            perspective.
