        <h1>Week 3 - 16/02/2024: Progress Update</h1>
        <p>I think the website is progressing well. This is my first time working in HTML and my first time
            designing anything similar to a website. I think for this first milestone the goal is to have a
            functional skeleton of the website, and that is what I have. It’s not pretty and it doesn’t do
            anything
            fancy, but its navigates between pages and displays content in a way that humans and (hopefully)
            bots
            can read and understand. I think I have all the needed semantic markup in. I still need to add a
            footer
            with links to external sites and implement the design page. However the blog page is done for now as
            soon as I post this one.
