        <h1>Week 9 - 18/04/24: JavaScript</h1>
        <p> I started experimenting with JavaScript on my website. From what I can gather, JavaScript in its simplest
            sense addresses the limitations of HTML by allowing for functions that can implement logic. It also allows
            for webpages to react dynamically without the user having to refresh the page. I am finding it hard to think
            of ways I can use this in my portfolio site. One idea of a use case I have is to automatically populate the
            blog index page with Blog post headings and the first few lines of each post. I haven’t been able to figure
            out how to access elements from a document that’s not the current page as (at least from my rudimentary
            understanding) an inactive page isn’t part of the DOM.</p>

        <p>Our lecturer showed us how to use JavaScript to add a navbar to each page and change it based on which page
            it is being added to. This is very useful and the previous navbar implementation annoyed me extremely. The
            way it was set up before now, any changes to the navbar had to be made on each individual page leaving a lot
            of room for inconsistency between navbars. </p>

        <p>In a similar sense, I intend to add a footer to each page with links to all my other portfolio-like pages. I
            further intend to implement a button in the footer of every page that doesn’t fit on the screen, in other
            words, a page where users have to scroll to reach the bottom. This button will be a simple back to top
            button, returning the users to the top of the page. I think JavaScript is useful here as I can use it to
            determine whether each page requires it or not and add it to the footer accordingly.</p>
