                <p>
                    These wireframes illustrate my initial idea of having a fairly common website layout whilst having
                    as much information accessible with as little as possible clicks.
                    I want my website to be very easy to use and feel familiar to as many users as possible. I further
                    wanted to make sure that no pages requires alot of scrolling. Pages with alot of content have tiles
                    displayed in a psuedo grid to maximise screen real estate. Each tile contains a descriptive summary
                    and an image where possible to allow users to know as much about it as they can beofre moving to a
                    new page.<br>
                    The navigation bar was envisioned to hve a full version normally and a compressed version when the user
                    scrolls down. This would have allowed the user to always access the navigation without it being too
                    much in the way. The current navbar is however very compact already so this was not implemented.
