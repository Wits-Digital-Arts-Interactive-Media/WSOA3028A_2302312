                <h2>Initial Wireframes</h2>
                <img src="../images/wireframes.png" alt="An image depicting the initial wireframes for the website."
                    width=90%>
                <p>
                    These wireframes illustrate my initial idea of having a fairly common website layout whilst having
                    as much information accessible with as little as possible clicks.
                    I want my website to be very easy to use and feel familiar to as many users as possible. I further
                    wanted to make sure that no pages requires alot of scrolling. Pages with alot of content have tiles
                    displayed in a psuedo grid to maximise screen real estate. Each tile contains a descriptive summary
                    and an image where possible to allow users to know as much about it as they can beofre moving to a
                    new page.<br>
                    The navigation bar was envisioned to have a full version normally and a compressed version when the
                    user
                    scrolls down. This would have allowed the user to always access the navigation without it being too
                    much in the way. The current navbar is however very compact already so this was not implemented.

            <section>
                <h2>Final Wireframes</h2>
                <p>Each page displays the navigation bar and footer bar. The navbar always stays static on the screen to
                    allow users to navigate at all times. The footer contains useful external links that users might
                    want to access after viewing my website. It is thus placed at the very bottome of each page.</p>
                <h3>Home Page</h3>
                <img src="images/home final.png" alt="Wireframes of the Home Page" width=70%>
                <p>
                    The homepage was designed to be simple. It's main purpose is to communicate to users the purpose of
                    the website. As such, it has a brief welcome section describing the site, followed by a short
                    biography section with my contact information.
                </p>

                <h3>Design Page</h3>
                <img src="images/Design final.png" alt="Wireframes of the Design Page" width=70%>
                <p>
                    The design page showcases various categories of web design. Each of these is arranged in a dynamic
                    grid that can be adjusted to accommodate tiles of various sizes. Each tile carries a title, short
                    description and sometimes images. The entire tile is a hyperlink to the specified Design page.
                </p>

                <h3>Projects Page</h3>
                <img src="images/projects final.png" alt="Wireframes of the Projects Page" width=70%>
                <p>
                    The Project Page similarly displays projects as tiles in a grid. This grid is slightly more rigid.
                    Each tile contains a title, a short description and an image.
                </p>

                <h3>Individual Project Page</h3>
                <img src="images/indiv project final.png" alt="Wireframes an Individual project" width=70%>
                <p>
                    The layout of this page was inspired by the layout used on Itch.io. Screenshots are displayed aside
                    while the full description of the project takes up two thirds of the page. This is ideal as it
                    allows readers to reference screenshots while reading, keeping them engaged.
                    At the bottom of each page there is a button that directs users to the download page on my itch.
                </p>

                <h3>Blogs Page</h3>
                <img src="images/blogs final.png" alt="Wireframes of the Blogs Page" width=70%>
                <p>
                    The blogs page has a lot of content so tiles are narrow and placed close together. Blog posts also
                    follow on one another and are dated, their order is important, so they take on more of a list like
                    structure.
                </p>

                <h3>Essays Page</h3>
                <img src="images/essays final.png" alt="Wireframes of the Essays Page" width=70%>
                <p>
                    The essays page is similar to the blog page, however since there are fewer essays tiles are slightly
                    bigger. With this increase in size, tiles include the introduction paragraph of each essay.
