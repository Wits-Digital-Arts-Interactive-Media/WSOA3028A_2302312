                <h2>Font</h2>
                <p>The chosen font for the website is Poppins. It's a clean font that, to me feels inviting butnot too
                    informal. It is legible, modern and quite simply my go-to font. since this website is aportayal of
                    me, it only seemed fitting.</p>

                    Colours
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, I had a selection of 6 vivid colours for my pallet. However, when trying to implement the
                    pallet I realized that I had far too many colours. I decided to keep it simple and opted for a black
                    and white scheme with a splash of accent colour every now and then. Crucially, the accent colours
                    are all various shades of one base colour: teal.

                <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
                <p> The website has a minimalist, dark background image by <a
                        href="https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/paper-style-wavy-background_18775847.htm#query=black%20minimalist%20background&position=2&from_view=keyword&track=ais_user&uuid=2837bc7f-f322-45dd-a74b-78272caf5f58">Freepik</a>
                    with all content being placed in bordered boxes. This
                    aids user understandibility as all relevant objects are clearly demarcated. These boxes as well as
                    the header and footer will have rounded corners to match the roundedness of the font. Generally,
                    headers and short pieces of text will be center aligned just like all the boxes, while longer text
                    pieces will be left aligned to aid readability. Intitially, the background was a solid black colour. The background images was added to lessen the harshness that the solid colour brought.
