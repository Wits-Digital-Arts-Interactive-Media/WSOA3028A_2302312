                    <h2>User experience</h2>
                    <p> I want my website to clearly showcase the skills I have learned throughout the course of my
                        degree.
                        I think the best way to do this is to present all my projects with a name, short description,
                        and a
                        list of the most prominent skills used/learned in the project. Users can then click on the
                        project
                        to see it in depth, with a long description, multiple screenshots, and a download link. I want
                        my
                        users to be able to quickly see all of my skills at a glance and then be able to see each skill
                        demonstrated in multiple projects. As such, they should have the ability to filter the project
                        page
                        by skill.</p>
                    <h2>Intended audience</h2>
                    <p>Primarily, my intended audience consists of potential clients, employers and recruiters. They
                        would
                        probably like to see a brief description of me, and then my past work and experience. Users
                        could
                        potentially be looking for experience with specific software or a specific skill.</p>
                    <h2>Project portrayal</h2>
                    <p>Projects should indicate the skills that went into making them. I believe this gives users a good
                        idea of what kind of project they are browsing before they even know what the project is. This
                        is
                        especially important for me as the majority of my projects are more technically impressive than
                        they
                        are visually impressive. I need to “sell” the projects based on the challenging aspect that they
                        achieved rather than the impressive art that went into them.</p>
                    <h2>Intention behind writing</h2>
                    <p>The Blog, Essay, and Design pages will supplement the projects page by providing extra insight
                        into
                        my
                        personality and thought process as I design. This is important as users look at more than just
                        technical experience and skill. A portfolio page should represent what sets me apart from other
                        designers/developers, and that is who I am and how I think.</p>
                    <h2>User Journey</h2>
                    <p>
                        It's important that the user journey is as simple as possible. Users should be able to
                        backtrack to any main page from anywhere. Furthermore, to avoid users being overwhelmed with choices,
                        specific pages like individual blogposts will only be accessible from the corresponding menu as users
                        will likely look for such a page with intention.
