        <h2>Essay 2: Digital Colonialism</h2>
        <section>
            <p>Colonialism is the practice of acquiring full or partial control over another country and
                exploiting it for its resources. The most famous example of this is Europe’s colonisation of
                the Global South where Europeans would gain native people’s trust by bringing them gifts
                and new technologies all while extracting resources and later, capturing the people as
                slaves. Similarly, big tech companies today offer seemingly free products and services while
                extracting user data and influencing user ideologies for their own gain. This practice is
                known as digital colonialism[1].</p>
            <p>
                Google offers various free services to users who create an account with them. This includes
                amongst others, 15GB of free cloud storage and an email address under their domain.
                Creating a Google account is necessary in order to use an Android smartphone. According
                to GeoPoll, 95% of South Africans have a smartphone [2] and 83.7% of those smartphones
                are Android devices[3]. Apple has similar policies and together with Google has 99.71% of
                the smartphone market share in the country. Herein lies the issue: almost every person
                relies on their smartphone daily, be it their sentimental photo library or navigating the world
                with GPS. These big American companies can make any number of new policies that are
                detrimental to users, and users will have no choice but to accept them as there are few to no
                alternative services that can fulfil their daily needs. Additionally, it is difficult and troublesome
                to switch over to an alternative. This is only one example of how big-tech companies entrap
                people by offering them free services.</p>
            <p>
                Recently, the tech industry has been flooded with Generative Pre-trained Transformers
                (GPTs). Seemingly every big tech company is trying to implement a GPT wherever they can.
                A GPT’s effectiveness relies heavily on having large amounts of training data on which it can
                base its responses. As such, data and the rights thereto are in high demand. Especially
                human-generated content like copyrighted writing and conversational texts. This is because
                GPTs aim to create content such as writing or images that look as if a human could have
                created it. The collection and selling of user data is nothing new, companies have been
                doing it since the early days of the internet for commerce purposes: An advertisement is
                more likely to be successful if the person seeing it is especially interested in the particular
                topic. If collecting data for advertisement purposes was ethically questionable, then
                collecting data to imitate your writing style, voice and likeness is outright unethical.
                Technically users agree to this data extraction when accepting the terms and conditions: A
                document that is so unnecessarily long that even a legally trained person would struggle to
                make sense of it. Even if you did read it, declining the terms means declining all the benefits
                that come with it such as cloud storage and the ability to use most smartphones.</p>
            <p>
                This data extraction shares a likeness to 17th-century colonialism, in that Europeans
                extracted resources without the explicit consent of the rightful owners of that resource, in the
                digital case, even though users give consent, most do so unknowingly. In a more literal
                sense, the very hardware that facilitates all these services requires precious minerals[1].
                These minerals are mostly mined and extracted from countries foreign to the companies
                doing the extraction and profiting therefrom.</p>
            <p>Another key aspect of colonialism is that of exerting control. Historically, this was done by
                claiming the foreign country as a colony and governing over its people. Big Tech companies
                exert influence by controlling what information people receive and what they don’t[4]. The
                primary source of most people’s information is via search engines or social media. Both of
                these are heavily biased based on who is interacting with them. This allows Big Tech
                companies to greatly influence a country’s politics and subsequently its policies, which
                ironically are also a government's best chance to fight digital colonialism. These companies
                effectively have a global monopoly on how information is spread and the world is just trusting
                them to not abuse it.</p>
            <p>
                Software is often proprietary [5], meaning users cannot read, modify or share the source
                code. This implicitly takes the control out of the consumer's hands: they can use their
                devices, and the software thereon but they cannot make any changes or fully know how the
                device works. It is this secrecy and lack of control that empowers tech companies so greatly:
                Governments struggle to pass laws and regulations if they cannot understand what they are
                limiting. People struggle to trust their devices if they cannot opt out of data collection. Both
                users and governments are entrapped due to the way these devices are intertwined with the
                daily lives of citizens. As developers, we should advocate open-source software where
                possible, and strive to make software as customizable as possible when open-source is not
                possible. By putting as much control as possible in the hands of our users, we limit the
                control our products influence over them. Furthermore, we should have extensive and
                understandable documentation to assist lawmakers in understanding the workings of our
                products. Not only is this the ethical thing to do, but it also prevents products from being
                unnecessarily banned by uninformed lawmakers.</p>
