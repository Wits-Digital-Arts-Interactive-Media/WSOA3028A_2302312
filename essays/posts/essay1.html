        <h2>Essay 1: A critical Analysis of Steam's Website UX/UI</h2>
        <section>
            <p>Steam is an online service that facilitates a marketplace for computer games and software. Despite the
                homepage
                of their website being visited roughly 170 million times per month [1], the user experience (UX) and
                user
                interface (UI) of the site are seemingly outdated with respect to modern design principles. The various
                flaws,
                and advantages in the website’s design, as well as the ethics of certain design choices, will be
                analysed and
                discussed in detail.</p>
            <p>The first principle where Steam’s website falls short is that of clarity [2]. Good UI should be clear,
                simple,
                and intuitive. Steam’s homepage has two navigation bars which, although only having eleven headings have
                a total
                of 133 hyperlinks, and all of them can be seen only by hovering your cursor over the navigation bar.
                Many of
                these hyperlinks are either redundant and lead the user to the exact same page, or completely useless.
                For
                example, on the store homepage, there are four hyperlinks visible without even having to scroll that
                take you to
                the store homepage, resulting in the page refreshing. These unnecessary interactable elements clutter
                the
                website, making it difficult for users to navigate the site.</p>
            <p>The website’s clarity and usability are further diminished by its inconsistent colour pallet, layout, and
                signifiers. The background, button, text style and accent colour change as one navigates the site with
                no
                apparent rules for when each style is used. Furthermore, the website is inconsistent with its use of
                signifiers.
                For example, clicking on your username in the top right corner will open a hamburger menu leading to
                various
                settings. Clicking on another instance of your username just a little further down and to the left, will
                open
                your “friend activity” page. Intuitively, at least one of these should take the user to their profile,
                and while
                they both do offer paths that lead to the user’s profile, it is not the primary action on either.</p>
            <p>A core part of any website is the user journey: A user should be able to intuitively find what they’re
                looking
                for with ease. Many parts of the Steam website succeed in this, but there are a few pages that are
                incredibly
                difficult to find unless you find them by accident. There exists, for example, a settings menu called
                “Friends
                List settings”. If one was to look for this page, one might intuitively start at the “Friends” page, and
                then go
                through all the subpages in the sidebar thereof. However, the abovementioned settings page is not there,
                nor is
                it in the account settings, or the store preferences. It can only be found by navigating to the “Chat”
                page and
                then clicking on the cog icon - an icon which is generally recognised as signifying settings but is not
                used for
                this purpose anywhere else on the site. A good user interface must be clear in visual appearance and
                concept.
                The wording should be simple and unambiguous.[2] The Steam website fails to adhere to the principles of
                Clarity,
                Consistency, and Comprehensibility.</p>
            <p>Another principle for good design is compatibility: good UI is dynamic and works on many devices and
                screen
                sizes. The Steam website has both a desktop and a mobile version. The mobile site makes use of a
                hamburger menu
                in the top left which houses the main navigation bar of the site, and it seamlessly scales all visual
                elements
                to fit proportionately on the smaller, portrait screen. Unfortunately, the issues of the desktop site
                carry over
                to the mobile site causing extra ambiguity: some buttons in the store page’s menu bar have sub-menus
                that are
                expanded by tapping the buttons, however, some buttons do not and instead take you to a different page.
                There is
                no visual indication of which buttons expand sub-menus and which buttons don’t. This causes users to
                unintentionally leave the page when simply looking at all the options of which, as mentioned before,
                there are
                already too many. This issue is only prevalent on the mobile site as the desktop site expands menus when
                the
                cursor hovers over it and touchscreen devices do not have an input method similar to hover. This design
                flaw
                could easily have been rectified with simple icons indicating submenus.</p>
            <p>The site not only adjusts itself based on the device it is viewed on but also based on the user accessing
                it.
                Some pages and buttons on the site are omitted when a user is not logged in. This makes the site simpler
                by
                limiting options that aren’t accessible without being logged in such as account settings. The hyperlink
                on the
                navigation bar, which is signified by the user’s username, is replaced with the “About” page when a user
                is not
                logged in. This makes intuitive sense as a user who is logged in, and thus already has an account,
                probably
                already knows what Steam is. Whereas a new user will be able to find the “About” page easily.</p>
            <p>Along with the mobile site, an adapted version of the desktop site is also loaded inside the Steam client
                to
                provide functionality that is not built into the client. The website evidently dynamically adapts to
                many
                situations to be more compatible and does so successfully in most instances. As such the principle of
                compatibility is semi-successfully implemented.</p>
            <p> The home page of any site is incredibly important, designers must consider the potential user’s frame of
                mind.
                [3] Steam is mostly used in the desktop client as all its products are exclusive to desktop and require
                the
                client to function. Most of its website users who reach the homepage are probably unsure of what Steam
                is, or
                they are trying to download the client onto a new computer. By contrast, the majority of users who want
                to
                browse the store, do so through the client. As such, having the store as the home page seems more like a
                business strategy than good design practice. The store page is the default page of Steam across all
                devices.
                This poses serious ethical issues as Steam prioritizes tempting users to purchase more games first and
                foremost,
                rather than providing the best experience in managing the products that users already bought.</p>
            <p>When evaluating UX/UI ethics, there are certain designs to look out for which facilitate
                “Macro-Persuasion” [4]
                three of these designs are prevalent on Steam’s website:</p>
            <p>Firstly, E-Commerce Discounting [4], in conjunction with the abovementioned ethical issue, Steam always
                has
                largely discounted games at the very top of their store page, which is always the first thing a user
                sees. This
                incentivises users to buy more products every time they open any instance of Steam.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Asymmetric User Effort: Buying a game on the Steam website is incredibly easy and can be done
                in less
                than 5 clicks. On the other hand, even though Steam’s refund policy is quite lenient, to request a
                refund, the
                user must find that specific purchase through a long chain of unintuitive clicks, most of which are on
                very
                small pieces of text. Seemingly, Steam used Fitt’s Law [5] to hide the refund request button.</p>
            <p>Finally, Digital Addiction [4]: Steam counts and shows the exact amount of time you have spent
                interacting with
                each of their products. Although this might seem like a feature that can help users limit their screen
                time, it
                acts similar to a trophy and Steam gives out cosmetic rewards for spending a lot of time in some games.
                Many
                Steam games award achievements when certain requirements are met by the player. This is indicated by a
                pop-up
                message that further incentivizes players to chase the next achievement. Steam rewards players for
                pursuing
                these achievements with cosmetic enhancements to the user’s profile.</p>
            <p>All of these are examples of how Steam uses design strategies to persuade users to give them their
                business.
                In conclusion, Steam’s website clearly fails in many important design principles and only somewhat
                succeeds in
                others. They further failed in their ethical obligation to prioritize user well-being and good user
                experience
                over good business strategies.</p>
