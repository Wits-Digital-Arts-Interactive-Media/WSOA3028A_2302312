                <h2>A 2D platformer all about breaking unfair rules</h2>
                <p> A game where players play as a cast-out puffball. Blatantly fighting against the rules is the only
                    way to move forward</p>
                <p>This Game was made as an entry to the 2023 Campus Game Jam. The theme was "Anarchy" </p>
                <p>This project required me to work incredibly fast and efficiently as we were only a team of two and the time limit with these jams are rather strict. I
                    developed the backend, and my partner did the front end.</p>
