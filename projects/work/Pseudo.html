                <h2>A Social Deduction card game for 4-8 players</h2>
                <p>This game was made for an entry to The Campus Game Jam in 2022 where it continued to win "Best Board
                    Game".</p>
                <p>Pseudo is a somewhat fresh take on a social deduction game that acts as a great ice-breaker. Players
                    have to answer prompts whilst acting out hilarious scenarios and sniffing out who among them is the
                    Deceiver.</p>
                <p> This game was made with 3 other team members in only 72 hours</p>
