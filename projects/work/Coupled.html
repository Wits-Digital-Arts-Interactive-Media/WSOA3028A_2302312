                <h2>A Unity add-on providing much needed functionality</h2>
                <p>Unity's physics engine boasts little to no built-in support for rope-like soft bodies. This project
                    serves as a technical demo of a custom-built dynamic rope generator that has realistic physics,
                    tension visualization, and breaking limits.</p>

                <p>It further has an adjustable resolution that is only limited by the capabilities of Unity's physics
                    engine. Allowing the
                    ropes to be only as realistic as needed. This add-on can be used in any other project to accurately
                    simulate rope-like bodies</p>
                    <p>The project was made as an game Desgin assignment, addressing Unity's shortcomings.</p>
