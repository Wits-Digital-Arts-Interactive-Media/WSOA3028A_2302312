                <h2>A digitized version of the popular Board-Game</h2>
                <p>Forbidden Island is a co-op board game where players play as adventurers trying to escape a sinking
                    island and capture all its treasures. This is a digital copy of Forbidden Island made for our game
                    design exam.</p>
                <p>This game is a digitized, local 2-player version of the popular board game made for windows. It was
                    my first digital exam and holds a special place on my portfolio. The game was made by me and two
                    other team members. I was responsible for the programming and implementation of the game, The UI and
                    art was handled by the other members.</p>
